**Project Title: NLP Analysis of Twitter Data on the Nagorno-Karabakh War**

## Overview:
This project aims to analyze public sentiment, opinions, and discussions surrounding the Karabakh War on Twitter using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Karabakh region has been a highly debated and emotionally charged topic, with discussions unfolding rapidly on social media platforms like Twitter. By leveraging NLP, this project seeks to provide insights into the discourse, sentiments, and key themes emerging from Twitter conversations related to the conflict.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project comprises tweets collected from Twitter's API using relevant hashtags, keywords, and geolocation targeting related to the Karabakh War. The dataset includes text, timestamps, user information, and metadata necessary for analysis.  (Like count , Date Review)

**1) Dating Data:**
   - Gather Twitter data related to the Nagorno-Karabakh War from relevant timeframes using Twitter API or available datasets.
   - Retrieve tweets containing relevant hashtags, keywords, or mentions related to the conflict.

**2) Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean the collected data by removing noise, such as URLs, special characters, and non-English text.
   - Tokenize the tweets into words or phrases.
   - Remove stop words and perform stemming or lemmatization to normalize the text.

**3) Visualization:**
   - Visualize the distribution of tweets over time to understand the dynamics of discussions during different phases of the war.
   - Create word clouds to highlight frequently used terms or hashtags in the tweets.
   - Plot sentiment trends to observe shifts in public opinion.

**4) Sentiment Intensity Analyzer:**
   - Develop a sentiment analysis tool to classify the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.
   - Utilize pre-trained sentiment analysis models or develop custom classifiers based on the data.
   - Evaluate the intensity of sentiment in tweets to gauge public sentiment towards the war.

**5) Machine Learning Model:**
   - Train a machine learning model to classify tweets based on their content, such as identifying tweets expressing support, criticism, or news updates about the war.
   - Extract relevant features from the preprocessed tweet data, such as word embeddings or TF-IDF vectors.
   - Utilize classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines.

**6) Model Hypertuning:**
   - Optimize the parameters of the machine learning model using techniques like grid search or random search.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve the model's performance in classifying tweets accurately.
   - Implement techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalization ability.

**7) Classification Report:**
   - Generate a classification report to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model.
   - Calculate metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for each class.
   - Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the model based on the classification report.

**8) Testing Model:**
   - Test the trained machine learning model on a separate test dataset to assess its performance on unseen data.
   - Evaluate the model's ability to generalize to new tweets and accurately classify them.
   - Fine-tune the model further if necessary based on the testing results to improve its performance.
